## Research Question

Using the information on the progression of diabetes in patients after one year of diagnosis, can we determine and predict for a new patient diagnosed with this disease, the main factor(s) to control in order to minimize such progression? 

### Abstract

4 sentence longer explanation about your research question. Include:

Derived from Diffusion-Weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DWI, d-MRI), we have derived "maps" of structural connectivity between brain regions.
Using these data, we may be able to understand relationships between brain regions and their relative connectivity, which can then be used for targetted interventions in neurodegenerative diseases.
Here, we tried to predict the connectivity between two unique brain regions based on all other known brain connectivity maps.
Based on the preliminary performance of this regressor, we found that the current model didn't provide consistent performance, but shows promise for success with more sophisticated methods.


- opportunity (what data do we have)
- challenge (what is the "problem" we could solve with this dataset)
- action (how will we try to solve this problem/answer this question)
- resolution (what did we end up producing)

### Introduction

Brief (no more than 1-2 paragraph) description about the dataset. Can copy from elsewhere, but cite the source (i.e. at least link, and explicitly say if it's copied from elsewhere).

### Methods

Brief (no more than 1-2 paragraph) description about how you decided to approach solving it. Include:

- pseudocode for this method (either created by you or cited from somewhere else)
- why you chose this method

### Results

Brief (2 paragraph) description about your results. Include:

- At least 1 figure
- At least 1 "value" that summarizes either your data or the "performance" of your method
- A short explanation of both of the above

### Discussion
Brief (no more than 1-2 paragraph) description about what you did. Include:

- interpretation of whether your method "solved" the problem
- suggested next step that could make it better.

### References
